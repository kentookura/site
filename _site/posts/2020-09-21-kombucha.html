        <p>I went to on vacation in Carinthia with some friends recently. We stayed a couple of days at a friends Aunt and she had a kombucha that she had maintained for 40 years. She always used tea made from fresh herbs taken from her garden and it was delicious. I had only tried the store-bought stuff before but I knew that you could make your own without much difficulty. She was kind enough to give me some of her SCOBY in a jar that I took back home to start my own.</p>
<p>I made the first batch from <a href="https://reddit.com/r/kombucha/wiki">r/kombucha's</a> master recipe:<br />
- 1l of black tea (brewed with 7g)<br />
- 70g sugar<br />
- 1-2 cups of kombucha</p>
<p>You should leave this mixture in open container with a breathable cover for a week. Afterwards you can bottle it in fermentation-grade glass bottles (no square bottles!) with some more sugar in the form of fruits, purees, juices or <a href="syrups">syrups</a> and let it sit for another 1-7 days. You can look at the details <a href="https://reddit.com/r/kombucha/wiki/how_to_start">here</a></p>

<p><img src="../images/kombucha-diagram.png" /> As you can see the sugar is broken up into glucose and fructose before it can be metabolized by the SCOBY. For the second batch I tried substituting sugar for honey. Honey contains glucose and fructose in unbound form, so fermentation happened a lot quicker and more sugar was metabolized in total. The end result was a very strange tasting drink, imagine honey with no sweetness diluted in sugar. Additionally, honey is known for it's anti-bacterial properties, so maybe honey is not the best choice as a primary source of sugar. I'll try using it in the second fermentation sometime.</p>
<p>Nevertheless I bottled the honey batch with some kiwi in one bottle and a ginger-orange syrup in another and it worked out great. The ginger batch had great fizz <img src="../images/kombucha-bottles.jpg" /></p>
