title: Kombucha Chemistry
---

I went to on vacation in Carinthia with some friends recently. We stayed a 
couple of days at a friends Aunt and she had a kombucha that she had maintained
for 40 years. She always used tea made from fresh herbs taken from her garden
and it was delicious. I had only tried the store-bought stuff before but I knew
that you could make your own without much difficulty. She was kind enough to 
give me some of her SCOBY in a jar that I took back home to start my own.  

I made the first batch from [ r/kombucha\'s ](https://reddit.com/r/kombucha/wiki) 
master recipe:  
- 1l of black tea (brewed with 7g)  
- 70g sugar  
- 1-2 cups of kombucha

You should leave this mixture in open container with a breathable cover for a 
week. Afterwards you can bottle it in fermentation-grade glass bottles (no 
square bottles!) with some more sugar in the form of fruits, purees, juices or 
syrups and let it sit for another 1-7 days.  You can look at the 
details [here](https://reddit.com/r/kombucha/wiki/how_to_start)     

## a bit of chemistry

As you can see the sugar is broken up into glucose and fructose before it can
be metabolized by the SCOBY.  For the second batch I tried substituting sugar 
for honey. Honey contains glucose and fructose in unbound form, so fermentation 
happened a lot quicker and more sugar was metabolized in total. The end result 
was a very strange tasting drink, imagine honey with no sweetness diluted in 
sugar. Additionally, honey is known for it\'s anti-bacterial properties, so 
maybe honey is not the best choice as a primary source of sugar. I\'ll try 
using it in the second fermentation sometime.

Nevertheless I bottled the honey batch with some kiwi in one bottle and a 
ginger-orange syrup in another and it worked out great.  The ginger batch had 
great fizz
