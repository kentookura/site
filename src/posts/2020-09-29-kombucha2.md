title: Upping Prduction Scale

I bought a 5 liter vessel for the main colony and 6 1 liter bottles for 2F.  
I\'m trying out a coffee-flavored 2F for the first time, should be interesting.
I also made a huge batch of ginger syrup because the last time was so good.  
The colony that I dumped into the honey is now being slowly weaned off of sugar.
Over the next few weeks it should be able to feed on 100% honey.
