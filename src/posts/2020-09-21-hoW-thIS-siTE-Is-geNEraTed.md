The first post of any advanced blog made with Hakyll will always be a post
detailing the creation process of said site. Why is this? Hakyll is a smart
program and presents the user with some nifty concepts. In turn, anybody who
wants to use Hakyll has to wrap their mind around these, which can be a
challenge.  
I decided to use Hakyll because the best way to learn any programming language
is to do some real work in said language. It is a great tool but I don't
think that I would have put up with the learning curve if I didn't think Haskell
was the greatest language out there. I'll post more about the setup once I do
something interesting with my code, at the moment there is nothing too exciting
going on.
