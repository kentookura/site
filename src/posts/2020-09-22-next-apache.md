There\'s an awesome second-hand bookstore in Paneska 28, Bratislava.
I found 7 Wheel of Time books there, a series which I\'ve been meaning to pick
up, 5 of which are (almost?) first editions. Look at these cheesy, awful, wonderful
covers:

Also this nice copy of The Once and Future King, apparently printed in 1987:

This one is my favorite, I *need* to read more from him:
