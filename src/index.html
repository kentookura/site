<p>Welcome to my blog! I am a student of mathematics at the university of
Vienna and I spend my free time programming, folding stuff out of paper and
playing the guitar. Here is where I will post pictures of my origami and
anything else I'd like to share. This page is heavily work in progress</p>

<p>Here's a list of the most recent posts:</p>
$partial("templates/post-list.html")$

<h2>TODO</h2>
<p>There's still a bunch of stuff I want to add to this site, but Hakyll can be tricky.</p>
<ul>
  <li><del>Thumbnails for the origami index file</del></li>
	<li>Set up the git http server</li>
	<li>A taggin system to filter posts and origami-models</li>
	<li>an XML RSS feed</li>
	<li>Dynamic page layout for screens of different sizes</li>
	<li>Better CSS overall</li>
	<li>A better photo workflow</li>
	<li>Integrate VimWiki and especially VimWikiDiary with the blog</li>
	<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>
To any Hakyll-pros that happen to see this: Feel free to send suggestions about how 
to achieve any of this! :) I'd love to get some mail.
