<p>I have not been receiving any photos or other files from friends
since apparently email is really too much to ask for :).   
So just select the files you want to send me and theyll go straight to my server.
Currently there is a limit for sending at most 8 files at once.
Thanks!

<form action="http://localhost:3000/upload" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
	<label class="custom-file-upload">
		<input type="file" name="photos"/>
		<input type="submit" name="upload" value="Send off!"/>
	</label>
</form>
